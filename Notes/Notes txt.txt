WHY REACT IS NAMED REACT ?
React is aptly named because: It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage. It's built around components that "react" and update.

Node.js: It's just a development environment which helps javascript to run on the server side.
Virtual DOM:
The virtual DOM (V-DOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”,
representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library
such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

Reconciliation:
Reconciliation is the process through which React updates the DOM. When a app's
state changes, React has to calculate if it is necessary to update the DOM. It does this
by creating a virtual DOM and comparing it with the current DOM.It follows diffing algorithm.

Diffing Algorithm:
The diffing algorithm in React allows for the efficient updates and rendering of these
DOM elements. As changes occur within the application's state or properties, React uses
its diff algorithm to compare the new Virtual DOM with the old one.

Difference between npm and npx:
NPM is a package management that is used to install, uninstall, and update Javascript
packages on your workstation, whereas NPX is a package executer that is used to directly
execute Javascript packages without installing them.


Commands:
npm install package-name -g-->"-g" refers to global.
Eg: npm install cowsay -g
Eg: npm uninstall cowsay
node -v
npm -v
npm list
npx -v
npm update
npm start
npm run build
npm init-->For locally installing the package.



NPM installs global packages in the following directory:
File Location:- C:\Users\abhis\AppData\Roaming\npm
NPM installs local packages in the folder from where you run the command.

NPX installs the packages temporarily in the following directory as a cache file:
File Location:- C:\Users\{YourUserName}\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_npx
File Location:-On My System:C:\Users\abhis\AppData\Local\npm-cache\_npx


Create React App Package:
"create-react-app" is a package.

We cannot create react app with uppercase letters.It will give the warning:
C:\Users\abhis>npx create-react-app My-App
Cannot create a project named "My-App" because of npm naming restrictions:

  * name can no longer contain capital letters

Please choose a different project name.


How To Create React App:
npm init-->To install create-react-app package locally
npm install -g create-react-app--"-g" used to install the package globally use init to install locally.
npx create-react-app <app-name> Eg:npx create-react-app my-app     
cd my-app      
npm start

React DOM:
The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app
and as an escape hatch to get outside the React model if you need to.

The react-dom package also provides module specific to client and server apps:
->react-dom/client
->react-dom/server

1.createElement() Method:
createElement() lets you create a React element.It serves as an alternative to writing JSX.
Eg: const element = createElement(type,props,...children)
Usage:
Creating an element without using JSX.


2.createRoot() Method:
createRoot(rootElement) is a React utility function used to create a React root element,
which is a DOM element in which UI components render themselves. It takes as a parameter the
root element that should be created.


JSX(Javascript XML):

JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any
createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.
You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React application.

JSX Rules:
1.Multiple React Elements:-It must be enclosed within parenthesis ().
2.Adjacent Level Elements:-Elements must be wrapped inside one parent container.
3.All the React elements must be closed.

React Fragment:(<></>)
<>Write the React JSX Code</>
Alternatively, you can use a "fragment" to wrap multiple lines.This prevents unnecessarily adding
extra nodes to the DOM.
A fragment looks like an empty React JSX tag:<></>

Expression in JSX:
With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { }.
The expression can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid JavaScript expression.

In ReactJS, the props are a type of object where the value of the attributes of a tag is stored.
The word "props" implies "properties", and its working functionality is similar to HTML attributes.
Basically these props components are read only components.

PropTypes:
PropTypes exports a range of validators that can be used to make sure the data you receive is valid. In this example, we’re using PropTypes.string. When an invalid value is provided for a prop, a warning will be shown in the JavaScript console. For performance reasons, propTypes is only checked in development mode.

Prop Drilling:
Prop drilling is a technique in React for passing data from a parent component to a child component, and then that child component passes the same data down to its own children, and so on

Refs are a function provided by React to access the DOM element and the React element that you might have created on your own.

The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value.
Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
This can improve performance.
The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function. You can learn more about useCallback in the useCallback chapter.


Performance:
The useMemo Hook can be used to keep expensive, resource intensive functions from needlessly running.

In this example, we have an expensive function that runs on every render.

When changing the count or adding a todo, you will notice a delay in execution.

Higher-order components (HOCs) are a powerful feature of the React library. They allow you to reuse component logic across multiple components. In React, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component as an argument and returns a new component that wraps the original component
